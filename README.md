# Number-Guessing-Game

I've crafted an entertaining number guessing game that relies solely on luck, offering an enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels. Leveraging modules like random for number generation and prettytable for score presentation, alongside the implementation of functions and file handling, I've designed a captivating game. With 3 lives to start, players earn points with each correct guess, aiming to reach successive levels. Each level advancement not only presents tougher challenges but also rewards players with bonus lives, ensuring an engaging and luck-driven journey throughout the game. While mathematical skills were crucial in the game's development, players can enjoy it purely based on chance
